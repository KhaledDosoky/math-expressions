# This Dockerfile should be placed in the project's root directory.
# It uses a three-stage process:
# 1. frontend_builder: Compiles the Next.js static output (to 'out').
# 2. python_builder: Installs all Python dependencies using 'uv'.
# 3. runtime: Creates the final, minimal image by combining the compiled frontend
#             and the installed Python packages from the previous stages.

# Install frontend dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy all source files
COPY frontend/ .

# Run the static build command. This creates the 'out/' directory.
# The `output: 'export'` flag MUST be set in frontend/next.config.js for this to work.

# 1. Copy the virtual environment (specifically the site-packages) from the builder stage
# We only need the installed packages.

# 2. Copy the Python application code
# Assuming your main FastAPI file is 'main.py' based on the standard name, 
# though the user's CMD suggests 'server:app'. We'll copy main.py and use it in the CMD.

# 3. CRITICAL: Copy the compiled Next.js static assets
# This copies the contents of the 'out/' folder from the frontend builder stage
# into the 'static_files' directory that main.py is configured to serve.
# The COPY command will automatically create the /backend/static_files directory.
